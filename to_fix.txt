1. update your requirements.txt files

2. move requirements.txt to the root directory

3. fix the right bcrypt. I am seeing 2 types of bcrypt 

4. user views.py, avoid repetition. Use data['username'] once per endpoint. same for email

5. user views.py. login endpoint. The search should be either email or username. not email or password

6. you can remove the other endpoints that came from the templates that we are not using 

7. remove line 20 user views.py
